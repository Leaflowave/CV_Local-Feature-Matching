# CV_Local-Feature-Matching(SIFT)
This project is based on ENGG5104 Image Processing and Computer Vision. And it a perfect example code for beginners. This series include five projects, and hope it's helpful for you.

The full instruction could be seen in instruction file. 

The goal of this project is to create a local feature-matching algorithm. The pipeline we suggest is a simplified version of the famous SIFT. The matching pipeline should work for instance-level matching-multiple views of the same physical scene.

Some interest points detection result and matching results are here.
